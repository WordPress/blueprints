We encourage you to contribute your own Blueprints to this repository!

## Build your first Blueprint

Not sure how? Check out the [Blueprints 101](./docs/index.md).

## Submit your Blueprint to this repository

To keep the submission process smooth, please follow these guidelines:

1. Submit [a Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/adamziel/blueprints/pulls) with your Blueprint.
2. The PR must contain a single `blueprint.json` file under the path `blueprints/your-blueprint-name/blueprint.json` (like [the examples here](https://github.com/adamziel/blueprints/tree/trunk/blueprints)).
3. Include all static files (WXR, ZIP, JPG, etc.) listed in the Blueprint in the submitted directory of your PR, and reference them via the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com` domain.
4. By submitting a Blueprint, you agree to license it under [GPLv2 or later license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html).

## Blueprint metadata

Each Blueprint should include metadata within the top-level "meta" key of the `blueprint.json` file.

Here's what's required:

- **Title:** a clear and concise name for your Blueprint.
- **Author:** your GitHub username, to let others know who created the Blueprint.

Optionally, you can add:

- **Description:** a brief explanation of what the Blueprint offers.
- **Categories:** specify relevant categories to help users find your Blueprint in the future Blueprints section on WordPress.org.

Here's an example:

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "title": "WooCommerce Developer Environment",
        "description": "A local development environment for WooCommerce that includes WP-CLI.",
        "author": "zieladam",
        "categories": ["woocommerce", "developer environment"]
    }
}
```
