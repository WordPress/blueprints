## What are Blueprints?

Blueprints are WordPress setup scripts that you can preview live in [WordPress Playground](https://w.org/playground). Blueprints contain all the installation instructions needed to setup WordPress, including plugins, themes, site options, starter content to import, and more.

The basic example below will load a Playground instance with the Hello Dolly plugin preinstalled and that opens in wp-admin plugins screen after it automattically logs in. 

```json
{
    "plugins": ["hello-dolly", "gutenberg"],
    "login": true,
    "landingPage": "/wp-admin/plugins.php"
}
```
