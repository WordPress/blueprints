# Troubleshoot and debug Blueprints

When you build Blueprints, you might run into issues. Here are tips and tools to help you debug them:

## Review Common gotchas

- Require `wp-load`: to run a WordPress PHP function using the `runPHP` step, you’d need to require [wp-load.php](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-load.php). So, the value of the `code` key should start with `"<?php require_once('wordpress/wp-load.php'); REST_OF_YOUR_CODE"`.
- Enable `networking`: to access wp.org assets (themes, plugins, blocks, or patterns), or load a stylesheet using [add_editor_style()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_editor_style/) (say, when [creating a custom block style](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2023/02/creating-custom-block-styles-in-wordpress-themes)), you’d need to enable the `networking` option: `"features": {"networking": true}`.

## Blueprints Builder

You can use an in-browser [Blueprints editor](https://playground.wordpress.net/builder/builder.html) to build, validate, and preview your Blueprints in the browser. 

> [!CAUTION]
> The editor is under development and the embedded Playground sometimes fails to load. To get around it, refresh the page. We're aware of that, and are working to improve the experience.

## Check for erros in the browser console

If your Blueprint isn’t running as expected, open the browser developer tools to see if there are any errors. 

To open the developer tools in Chrome, Firefox, Safari*, and Edge: press `Ctrl + Shift + I` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + Option + I` on macOS.

> [!WARNING]
> If you haven't yet, enable the Develop menu: go to **Safari > Settings... > Advanced** and check **Show features for web developers**.

The developer tools window allows you to inspect network requests, view console logs, debug JavaScript, and examine the DOM and CSS styles applied to your webpage. This is crucial for diagnosing and fixing issues with Blueprints.

## Ask for help

The community is here to help! If you have questions or comments, [open a new issue](https://github.com/adamziel/blueprints/issues) in this repository. Remember to include the following details:
